The name is often used as a title for Yahweh, indicating that Yahweh is considered to be the highest God.\n\nIn some passages (such as Isaiah 14:13-14 and Numbers 24:16), El Elyon is mentioned separately from Yahweh, suggesting a distinction between the two. However, in other places (such as Psalm 97:9 and 2 Samuel 22:14), El Elyon is used interchangeably with Yahweh, indicating that they are considered to be one and the same deity.\n\nTherefore, while there is some ambiguity, it can be said that Yahweh is often referred to as El Elyon in the Hebrew Bible."
