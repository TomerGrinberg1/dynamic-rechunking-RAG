Such a hypothetical mission is envisioned to be possible in the late 2020s or early 2030s . However , there have been discussions to launch Neptune missions sooner . In 2003 , there was a proposal in NASA 's `` Vision Missions Studies '' for a `` Neptune Orbiter with Probes '' mission that does Cassini - level science . Another , more recent proposal was for Argo , a flyby spacecraft to be launched in 2019 , that would visit Jupiter , Saturn , Neptune , and a Kuiper belt object . The focus would be on Neptune and its largest moon Triton to be investigated around 2029 . The proposed New Horizons 2 mission ( which was later scrapped ) might also have done a close flyby of the Neptunian system .",

As a result , under former CPC general secretary and President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao , the PRC initiated policies to address issues of equitable distribution of resources , but the outcome was not known as of 2014 . More than 40 million farmers were displaced from their land , usually for economic development , contributing to 87,000 demonstrations and riots across China in 2005 .

This compromise tariff received the support of most northerners and half of the southerners in Congress . The reductions were too little for South Carolina , and on November 24 , 1832 , a state convention adopted the Ordinance of Nullification , which declared that the Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 were unconstitutional and unenforceable in South Carolina after February 1 , 1833 . The state initiated military preparations to resist anticipated federal enforcement . On March 1 , 1833 , Congress passed both the Force Bill -- authorizing the President to use military forces against South Carolina -- and a new negotiated tariff , the Compromise Tariff of 1833 , which was satisfactory to South Carolina . The South Carolina convention reconvened and repealed its Nullification Ordinance on March 15 , 1833 , but three days later nullified the Force Bill as a symbolic gesture to maintain its principles .",

        "question": "how many points for a field goal in rugby league",
        "long_answer": "A drop goal ( also known as a field goal ) is worth only one point and is thus the least chosen method of scoring . It is attempted during general play , and to be valid must be made by a drop kick , and as with penalty and conversion goals , must pass both over the crossbar and between the uprights of the goal - posts . Drop goals are usually attempted when in good field position in an attempt to secure a win late in a close game or when the scores are within a converted try ( 6 points ) of each other so that , if successful , their opponents must score a minimum of two times to avoid losing . Less commonly , drop goals may be attempted just before half - time , to secure the most points scored in the first half . Additionally , it is a common way to win matches in competitions that use golden point extra time to decide games that are tied after normal time has elapsed . Unnecessary or unlikely attempts at Field Goal have become less common with the advent of the Zero tackle rule , with a miss generally resulting in a Seven - tackle set restart from the 20m line for the opposing side .",

The ending , which is where this work differs most from Shinkai 's previous efforts , will doubtless be controversial and may leave some fans unsatisfied , as it opens itself to multiple interpretations . Some may feel as if it just ends without resolving anything , but if one considers Takaki 's few lines of narration in part two , how that part ends , and how everything fits together , it becomes clearer that actually resolving things was never the point . Whereas Voices was about trying to maintain a connection and Place Promised was about reestablishing one , Five Centimeters is ultimately about moving on from past connections instead of just living in the past , about finding a way to become happy in the present rather than just pining for what has been lost over time . In that sense Five Centimeters is Shinkai 's most mature and complicated work yet . '' -- Theron Martin , Anime News Network",

Title Original airdate `` Squad Jam '' `` Sukuwaddo Jamu '' ( \u30b9\u30af\u30ef\u30c3\u30c9 \u30fb \u30b8\u30e3\u30e0 ) April 8 , 2018 In the online virtual reality game , Gun Gale Online , a girl with the username Llenn participates in a team - based Squad Jam event alongside her teammate M. Taking cover , the two observe as one skilled team takes out another , deducing that they must be combat pros using GGO to gain battle experience . While the other teams eliminate each other , Llenn and M retreat to the residential area to come up with a plan against the pros . Using her small stature and quick speed to her advantage , Llenn launches a surprise attack on the pro team , leading the survivors to resign . In the real world , Llenn 's user , Karen Kohiruimaki receives praise for her efforts . `` GGO '' April 15 , 2018 Karen Kohiruimaki , who has a complex about her tall height , takes up an interest in VR gaming , but ends up constantly panicking and logging out whenever her Llenn avatar turns out to be too tall or otherwise outrageous . After going through several games , Karen eventually tries Gun Gale Online and becomes delighted with the diminutive avatar that 's generated for her , only to discover that the game she picked is one of gunfire and survival . Deciding to stick with the game anyway , Karen gradually improves her skill and updates her outfit to a pink color to suit her taste . Upon finding herself surrounded by other players , Llenn manages to defeat them using pink camouflage and high speed , quickly gaining a reputation as `` The Pink Devil '' . Later , Llenn is befriended by another female player named Pitohui , who helps her pick out a new gun which she nicknames P - chan . Forming a squadron together , Pitohui makes a promise with Llenn that if she can manage to defeat her one day , they will meet each other in real life . `` Fan Letter '' `` Fan Ret\u0101 '' ( \u30d5\u30a1\u30f3 \u30ec\u30bf\u30fc ) April 22 , 2018 Pitohui tells Llenn about the upcoming Squad Jam team battle royale tournament , inspired by the events of the previous Ballet of Bullets tournament . Unable to participate due to real life obligations , Pitohui suggests that Llenn should enter the tournament in a team with another male player . After her friend fails to get her tickets to a concert taking place on the same day , Llenn agrees to enter the tournament , meeting up with her arranged partner , M , while also learning she has been appointed as the team leader as part of a strategy . Later , Karen writes a fan letter to singer Elsa Kanzaki , whose concert she could n't attend , detailing how her songs had helped her through hard times . On the day of the Squad Jam , M gives Llenn a combat knife to use as a backup weapon before the tournament gets underway . `` Death Game '' `` Desu G\u0113mu '' ( \u30c7\u30b9 \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0 ) April 29 , 2018 With three teams remaining in Squad Jam , Llenn and M find themselves up against another team using hovercrafts . Using a shield for cover , M uses his skills as a sniper to take out the opposing team without relying on the game 's assist systems . Just as the two are suddenly ambushed by the remaining team , SHINC , and retreat to a mountain area , M reads a letter and attempts to kill Llenn . Managing to reverse the situation by activating the safety on M 's gun , Llenn is surprised to find M caving under pressure when questioned about his actions . 5 `` Leave the Last Battle to Me '' `` Rasuto Batoru wa Watashi ni '' ( \u30e9\u30b9\u30c8 \u30d0\u30c8\u30eb \u306f \u79c1 \u306b ) May 6 , 2018 M , who reveals his true nature , explains that he was frightened over what Pitohui would do to him in real life if he dies in the game , so he attempted to kill Llenn in order to become leader and surrender . Leaving M alone , Llenn tries to take on SHINC herself , only to get caught up in their trap . Realizing she can not run away , Llenn faces SHINC head on , soon receiving backup from M. Coming down to a final battle against the remaining member , Llenn is protected by P - chan and wins using the knife she received from M. Later in the real world , Karen gets a haircut to symbolize overcoming her complex while also meeting a group of high school girls , who are revealed to be the team she faced in GGO . 5.5 `` Refrain '' `` Rufuran '' ( \u30eb\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3 ) May 13 , 2018 Recap of the first five episodes . 6 `` SAO Loser '' `` SAO R\u016bz\u0101 '' ( SAO \u5931\u6557 \u8005 ) May 20 , 2018 The rhythm athletics club who Llenn faced in the Squad Jam as SHINC come over to Karen 's place to learn her secrets . Later , as Karen receives news about the next Squad Jam event while heading home to Hokkaido to see her parents , she is approached by M 's real life persona , G\u014dshi As\u014dgi . He explains how Pitohui became obsessed with Sword Art Online during its beta test , becoming enraged when she was unable to take part in the death game that was the SAO Incident . Believing that Pitohui intends to commit suicide if she dies during the next Squad Jam , G\u014dshi asks Karen to defeat Pitohui in order to fulfil their promise to meet up in real - life . Agreeing to help , Karen calls upon her best friend Miyu Shinohara , aka Fukaziroh , to form a team with her . 7 `` Second Squad Jam '' `` Sekando Sukuwaddo Jamu '' ( \u30bb\u30ab\u30f3\u30c9 \u30fb \u30b9\u30af\u30ef\u30c3\u30c9 \u30fb \u30b8\u30e3\u30e0 ) May 27 , 2018 Receiving some funds from G\u014dshi upon her arrival in GGO , Fukaziroh decides to buy a pair of grenade launchers as her main weapons . On the day of Squad Jam 2 , Llenn has a brief confrontation with Pitohui before the tournament gets underway . 8 `` Booby Trap '' `` B\u016bb\u012b Torappu '' ( \u30d6\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc \u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7 ) June 3 , 2018 Squad Jam 2 begins with Llenn 's team and Pitohui 's team starting on opposite ends of the playing field . Fukaziroh quickly runs into trouble when her legs are temporarily blown off by a booby trap , but Llenn manages to take out the first opposing team without too much trouble . The pair then head to a train station , where Llenn gives Fukaziroh directions to launch grenades at the enemy . After discovering that seven teams have n't moved , Llenn deduces they are all working with each other to take down Pitohui . 9 `` Ten Minute Massacre '' `` Juppunkan no \u014csatsu '' ( \u5341\u5206 \u9593 \u306e \u93d6\u6bba ) June 9 , 2018 Undeterred by the number of opposing teams , Pitohui and her team launch an ambush on them , taking them all out within ten minutes . Meanwhile , Llenn and Fukaziroh make their way through a dome , having to resort to using a smokescreen tactic when they are discovered . After taking out the other players in the dome , the girls end up having to deal with the remaining player , Clarence , for her remaining magazines , before coming up against the skilled MMTM team . 10 `` The Devil 's Comeback '' `` Ma\u014d Fukkatsu '' ( \u9b54\u738b \u5fa9\u6d3b ) June 16 , 2018 Helped out by SHINC 's Eva , who forces MMTM to retreat , Llenn explains the situation concerning Pitohui to her . Following this , Eva leads SHINC in an assault against PM4 , using one of their dead teammate 's body as a pedestal an anti-tank rifle to destroy M 's shield . This provides Llenn with the opportunity to make a beeline towards Pitohui , only for another team 's sniper to hit her first , bringing her down to a sliver of health . With Pitohui passed out and MMTM closing in on their location , the rest of PM4 sacrifice themselves to protect Pitohui before she regains consciousness . 11 `` Psycho Llenn '' `` Ikareta Ren '' ( \u30a4\u30ab \u308c \u305f \u30ec\u30f3 ) June 23 , 2018 After Pitohui finishes off MMTM all by herself , Fukaziroh pins an uncertain Llenn in place while she and the rest of SHINC launch an attack on Pitohui and M. Although SHINC gets wiped out , Llenn is motivated into action , luring out Pitohui and M as they pursue her in a vehicle . Just as Llenn is cornered , Fukaziroh comes to her rescue in her own vehicle , resulting in a car chase between hot geysers that culminates in a one - on - one confrontation between Llenn and Pitohui . 12 `` Applause '' `` Hakushu '' ( \u62cd\u624b ) June 30 , 2018 Pitohui 's attempt at killing Llenn with her own weapon backfires when P - chan self - destructs , but she still manages to put a stop to Llenn 's counterattacks before killing M for his betrayal . However , Fukaziroh manages to give Llenn the opportunity to deal Pitohui a fatal blow , reminding her of their promise before finishing her off . After Squad Jam 2 ends with Llenn 's team ending up in second place due to a sneak attack by the remaining team , Goushi invites Karen and Miyu to meet with the real - life Pitohui , explaining how he formed a masochistic relationship with her . Goushi brings the two to Elsa Kanzaki 's , where it is revealed Elsa is Pitohui herself . Although Karen had already figured out Pitohui 's identity due to Elsa and Goushi knowing details that they would only know from reading her fan letter , she is taken aback when Elsa kisses her . A post credits scene shows LLENN and Pitohui back in Gun Gale Online as they enjoy the game again together .",

In Proverbs 15 : 33 , the fear of the Lord is described as the `` discipline '' or `` instruction '' of wisdom . Writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia , Jacques Forget explains that this gift `` fills us with a sovereign respect for God , and makes us dread , above all things , to offend Him . '' In an April 2006 article published in Inside the Vatican magazine , contributing editor John Mallon writes that the `` fear '' in `` fear of the Lord '' is often misinterpreted as `` servile fear '' ( the fear of getting in trouble ) when it should be understood as `` filial fear '' ( the fear of offending someone whom one loves ) .",

        "long_answer": "The change in the particle size of the rock during the process of metamorphism is called recrystallization . For instance , the small calcite crystals in the sedimentary rock limestone and chalk change into larger crystals in the metamorphic rock marble ; in metamorphosed sandstone , recrystallization of the original quartz sand grains results in very compact quartzite , also known as metaquartzite , in which the often larger quartz crystals are interlocked . Both high temperatures and pressures contribute to recrystallization . High temperatures allow the atoms and ions in solid crystals to migrate , thus reorganizing the crystals , while high pressures cause solution of the crystals within the rock at their point of contact .",

During the 18th and 19th centuries , Rotten Row was a fashionable place for upper - class Londoners to be seen horse riding . Today it is maintained as a place to ride horses in the centre of London , but it is little used . Rotten Row was established by William III at the end of the 17th century . Having moved court to Kensington Palace , William wanted a safer way to travel to St. James 's Palace . He created the broad avenue through Hyde Park , lit with 300 oil lamps in 1690 -- the first artificially lit highway in Britain . The lighting was a precaution against highwaymen , who lurked in Hyde Park at the time .

Customers with affected devices can fill out a claim form to confirm eligibility for replacement . Defective devices will be replaced within six weeks and will carry 90 - day warranties . Customers who have personalized iPod Nano devices will not be able to receive personalization on their replacement devices . During the replacement process , there have been several reports of users receiving an iPod Nano 6th generation as replacement instead of the expected 1st generation device that users sent in during the recall . Because using the iPod nano 6th generation with a Mac computer requires iTunes 10 or higher , which in turn requires Mac OS X Leopard system software , Apple will upgrade the system software of participants running earlier versions of OS X , on request but this leaves users that do not have access to iTunes without a working device ( because Apple changed the hashing of the music database which prevented the 6th generation iPod Nano from being used with open source software via libgpod ) .",

However , a spokesman for the Australian Arts Minister George Brandis confirmed that the fifth installment was set to shoot exclusively in Australia after the government agreed to repurpose $20 million of tax incentives originally intended for the remake of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea , thus edging out Mexico and South Africa as filming locations . According to Australian film industry sources , on location pre-production started in late September 2014 and its cost is around $250 million . This was officially confirmed by Disney and the Queensland Arts Minister on October 2 , 2014 , stating that filming will take place exclusively in Queensland , Australia , being the largest production to ever shoot in the country . Village Roadshow Studios and Whitsundays were officially confirmed as filming locations . On January 1 , 2015 , The Rainbow Gypsy , a 15 - year - old replica of an 1897 Scottish bawley , sailed into the Gold Coast to start the extensive refit , which will include a new bowsprit and reconfigured decks and cabins in order to become the Dying Gull , a single - masted ghost ship .

        "long_answer": "The Currie Cup is one of the oldest rugby competitions , with the first games played in 1889 but it was only in 1892 that it became officially known as the Currie Cup . The competition had its humble beginnings as an inter-province competition in 1884 , but when the South African Rugby Board was founded in 1889 it decided to organize a national competition that would involve representative teams from all the major unions . The original participating unions were Western Province , Griqualand West , Transvaal and Eastern Province . The first tournament was held in Kimberley and was won by Western Province . For a prize they received a silver cup donated by the South African Rugby Board , now displayed at the SA Rugby Museum in Cape Town . The story of how the Currie Cup came to be comes from the first overseas rugby team to tour South Africa in 1891 , The British Isles , who carried with them a particularly precious bit of cargo . Among the bags , boots and balls was a golden cup given to them by Sir Donald Currie , owner of Union - Castle Lines , the shipping company that transported them to the southern tip of Africa . Sir Donald was clear with his instructions -- hand this trophy over to the team in South Africa that gives you the best game ; and after a spirited display where the unbeaten British Lions narrowly won 3 - 0 , Griqualand West became the first ever holders of the Currie Cup . They then handed the trophy over to the South African rugby board and it became the floating trophy for the Currie Cup competition . The inaugural Currie Cup tournament was thus held in 1892 with Western Province earning the honour of holding it aloft as the first official winners .",

The first problem is that they posit rewards as a guarantee of performance , when rewards are supposed to be based on merit in their argument . It is argued that if abilities were inherent , there would be no need of a reward system . Secondly , Davis and Moore do not clearly indicate why some positions should be worth more than others , other than the fact that they are remunerated more , claiming , for example , that teachers are equally , if not more , functionally necessary than athletes and movie stars , yet , they receive significantly lower incomes . These critics have suggested that structural inequality ( inherited wealth , family power , etc . ) , is itself a cause of individual success or failure , rather than a consequence of it . Class analysts point out that it is not merely income that determines inequality but wealth , access to social networks , and cultural practices that put some individuals in better positions than others to succeed .",

In the United States , the use of deadly force by sworn law enforcement officers is lawful when the officer reasonably believes the subject poses a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to themselves or others . The use of deadly force by law enforcement is also lawful when used to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon when the officer believes escape would pose a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to members of the public . Common law allowed officers to use any force necessary to effect a felony arrest but this was narrowed in the Tennessee v. Garner ruling in 1985 when the U.S. Supreme Court said that `` deadly force ... may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or others .

In that election , more Canadians voted for anti-free trade parties ( the Liberals and the New Democrats ) but the split caused more seats in parliament to be won by the pro-free trade Progressive Conservatives ( PCs ) . Mulroney and the PCs had a parliamentary majority and were easily able to pass the 1987 Canada - U.S. FTA and NAFTA bills . However , he was replaced as Conservative leader and prime minister by Kim Campbell . Campbell led the PC party into the 1993 election where they were decimated by the Liberal Party under Jean Chr\u00e9tien , who had campaigned on a promise to renegotiate or abrogate NAFTA ; however , Chr\u00e9tien subsequently negotiated two supplemental agreements with the new U.S. president . In the U.S. , Bush , who had worked to `` fast track '' the signing prior to the end of his term , ran out of time and had to pass the required ratification and signing of the implementation law to incoming president Bill Clinton . Prior to sending it to the United States Senate Clinton added two side agreements , The North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation ( NAALC ) and the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation ( NAAEC ) , to protect workers and the environment , plus allay the concerns of many House members .

The Cripps Mission had failed , and on 8 August 1942 , Gandhi made a call to Do or Die in his Quit India speech delivered in Bombay at the Gowalia Tank Maidan . The All - India Congress Committee launched a mass protest demanding what Gandhi called `` An Orderly British Withdrawal '' from India . Even though it was wartime , the British were prepared to act . Almost the entire leadership of the INC was imprisoned without trial within hours of Gandhi 's speech . Most spent the rest of the war in prison and out of contact with the masses . The British had the support of the Viceroy 's Council ( which had a majority of Indians ) , of the All India Muslim League , the princely states , the Indian Imperial Police , the British Indian Army and the Indian Civil Service . Many Indian businessmen profiting from heavy wartime spending did not support Quit India Movement . Many students paid more attention to Subhas Chandra Bose , who was in exile and supporting the Axis Powers . The only outside support came from the Americans , as President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressured Prime Minister Winston Churchill to give in to some of the Indian demands . The Quit India campaign was effectively crushed .

On April 6 , 1967 he gave a speech to 1,500 students and others at Boston University on abortion and birth control . He gave a female student one condom and a package of contraceptive foam . Baird was arrested and convicted as a felon , facing up to ten years in jail . He spent three months in Boston 's Charles Street Jail . During his challenge to the Massachusetts law , the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts stated that `` there is nothing to be gained by court action of this kind . The only way to remove the limitations remaining in the law is through the legislative process . '' Despite this opposition , Baird fought for five years until Eisenstadt v. Baird legalized birth control for all Americans on March 22 , 1972 . Eisenstadt v. Baird , a landmark right to privacy decision , became the foundation for such cases as Roe v. Wade and the 2003 gay rights victory Lawrence v. Texas .",

Scientists from Uppsala University and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility used X-ray synchrotron microtomography to study the fossilised interior of the skeleton 's humerus , finding organised tubular structures akin to modern vertebrate bone marrow . Eusthenopteron is closely related to the early tetrapods , which ultimately evolved into the land - dwelling mammals and lizards of the present day .",

It was a calculated risk that backfired , however , because the harshness of some of the acts made it difficult for moderates in the colonies to speak in favor of Parliament . The acts promoted sympathy for Massachusetts and encouraged colonists from the otherwise diverse colonies to form committees of correspondence which sent delegates to the First Continental Congress . The Continental Congress created the Continental Association , an agreement to boycott British goods . Additionally , it was decided that if the Coercive Acts were not reversed after a year , goods were to stop being exported to Great Britain as well . The Congress also pledged to support Massachusetts in case of attack , which meant that all of the colonies would become involved when the American Revolutionary War began at Lexington and Concord .",

        "long_answer": "The usual form of burial during this period was inhumation . The earliest Mycenaean burials were mostly in individual graves in the form of a pit or a stone - lined cist and offerings were limited to pottery and occasional items of jewellery . Groups of pit or cist graves containing elite members of the community were sometimes covered by a tumulus ( mound ) in the manner established since the Middle Helladic . It has been argued that this form dates back to the Kurgan culture ; however , Mycenaean burials are in actuality an indigenous development of mainland Greece with the Shaft Graves housing native rulers . Pit and cist graves remained in use for single burials throughout the Mycenaean period alongside more elaborate family graves . The shaft graves at Mycenae within Grave Circles A and B belonging to the same period represent an alternative manner of grouping elite burials . Next to the deceased were found full sets of weapons , ornate staffs as well as gold and silver cups and other valuable objects which point to their social rank .",

Puritans were generally members of the Church of England who believed that the Church of England was insufficiently reformed , retaining too much of its Roman Catholic doctrinal roots , and who therefore opposed royal ecclesiastical policy under Elizabeth I of England , James I of England , and Charles I of England . Most Puritans were `` non-separating Puritans '' , meaning that they did not advocate setting up separate congregations distinct from the Church of England ; a small minority of Puritans were `` separating Puritans '' who advocated setting up congregations outside the Church . The Pilgrims were a Separatist group , and they established the Plymouth Colony in 1620 . Non-separating Puritans played leading roles in establishing the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629 , the Saybrook Colony in 1635 , the Connecticut Colony in 1636 , and the New Haven Colony in 1638 . The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations was established by settlers expelled from the Massachusetts Bay Colony because of their unorthodox religious opinions . Puritans were also active in New Hampshire before it became a crown colony in 1691 .",

        "long_answer": "A number of inherited diseases involve defects in carrier proteins in a particular substance or group of cells . Cysteinuria ( cysteine in the urine and the bladder ) is such a disease involving defective cysteine carrier proteins in the kidney cell membranes . This transport system normally removes cysteine from the fluid destined to become urine and returns this essential amino acid to the blood . When this carrier malfunctions , large quantities of cysteine remain in the urine , where it is relatively insoluble and tends to precipitate . This is one cause of urinary stones . Some vitamin carrier proteins have been shown to be overexpressed in patients with malignant disease . For example , levels of riboflavin carrier protein ( RCP ) have been shown to be significantly elevated in people with breast cancer .",

These firing ranges would be open to the public when not in use . In response to requests from the public , the Coast Guard held a series of public meetings in nine U.S. cities to solicit comment . During these meetings many people voiced concerns about the plan and its impact on the environment . On December 18 , 2006 , the Coast Guard announced its decision to withdraw the entire proposal .

Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency , though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia . Madison issued four religious proclamations while President , but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment . On the other hand , both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol . Years before the ratification of the Constitution , Madison contended `` Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large , still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body . '' After retiring from the presidency , Madison wrote of `` total separation of the church from the state . '' `` `` Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States , '' Madison wrote , and he declared , `` practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both , and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States . '' In a letter to Edward Livingston Madison further expanded , `` We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts . do better without Kings & Nobles than with them . The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that Religion flourishes in greater purity , without than with the aid of Govt . '' Madison 's original draft of the Bill of Rights had included provisions binding the States , as well as the Federal Government , from an establishment of religion , but the House did not pass them .",

Small insurers , like individual consumers , tend to have annual costs that fluctuate far more than larger insurers . The term `` Professional Caregiver Insurance Risk '' explains the inefficiencies in health care finance that result when insurance risks are inefficiently transferred to health care providers who are expected to cover such costs in return for their capitation payments . As Cox ( 2006 ) demonstrates , providers can not be adequately compensated for their insurance risks without forcing managed care organizations to become price uncompetitive vis - a-vis risk retaining insurers . Cox ( 2010 ) shows that smaller insurers have lower probabilities of modest profits than large insurers , higher probabilities of high losses than large insurers , provide lower benefits to policyholders , and have far higher surplus requirements .

The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions , which break large molecules into smaller ones , releasing energy in the process , as weak so - called `` high - energy '' bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products . Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity . Cellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction which releases heat . The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps , most of which are redox reactions themselves . Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction , it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell because of the slow release of energy from the series of reactions .",

Many of the students who planned or joined the uprising took part , as did other witnesses , including photographer Peter Magubane , reporter Sophie Tema , and Tim Wilson , the white doctor who pronounced Hector Pieterson dead in Baragwanath hospital . The programme was broadcast on SABC and on a number of local radio stations throughout South Africa . The following year , BBC Radio 4 and BBC World Service broadcast a revised version containing fresh interviews and entitled The Day Apartheid Died . The programme was runner - up at the 1998 European Community Humanitarian Office ( ECHO ) TV & Radio Awards and also at the 1998 Media Awards of the One World International Broadcasting Trust , and was highly commended at the 1998 Prix Italia radio awards . In May 1999 , it was re-broadcast by BBC Radio 4 as The Death of Apartheid with a fresh introduction , providing added historical context for a British audience , by Anthony Sampson , former editor of Drum magazine and author of the authorised biography ( 1999 ) of Nelson Mandela . Sampson linked extracts from the BBC Sound Archive that charted the long struggle against apartheid from the Sharpeville massacre of 1960 , through the riots of 1976 and the murder of Steve Biko , and right up to Mandela 's release from prison in 1990 and the future president 's speech in which he acknowledged the debt owed by all black South Africans to the students who gave their lives in Soweto on 16 June 1976 .",

On June 16, 1976, students from Soweto's secondary schools began protests against the decree.\n2. The demonstrations quickly escalated into violent clashes with police.\n\n**Consequences:**\n\n1. **Loss of Life:** At least 176 people died (with estimates as high as 700).\n2. **International Reaction:** The uprising drew global attention, highlighting the brutality of apartheid and galvanizing international opposition to it.\n3. **Escalation of Apartheid Resistance:** The uprising was a significant milestone in the anti-apartheid struggle, leading to increased protests and resistance against the government.\n4. **United Nations Action:** The UN Security Council condemned South Africa for its actions on June 22, 1976.\n\nOverall, the Soweto Uprising marked a pivotal moment in the fight against apartheid, exposing its brutality and contributing to its eventual collapse."

The transfer window saw virtually no players join the club until the last day of the season , when a last - minute burst of activity saw four different players all join in the space of around 10 hours . The free - flowing football of the previous season was suddenly rare to behold , and while City rarely seemed likely to drop below second in the table , they posed little title challenge all season . In the UEFA Champions League , the club was eliminated at the group stage for a second successive season , in a result which seemed to confirm Mancini 's reputation as far better at managing in domestic games than European , while a second FA Cup final in three seasons ended in a 1 -- 0 defeat to relegated Wigan Athletic . The loss resulted in Mancini 's dismissal , ostensibly as he had failed to reach his targets for the season but with many in the press suggesting a break - down of relations between Mancini and his players but also between the Italian and his board - level superiors , while a refusal to promote young players was also cited .

        "question": "statutory rape in ontario canada age of consent",
        "long_answer": "Criminal law ( including the definition of the age of consent ) is in the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government , so the age of consent is uniform throughout Canada . Section 151 of the Criminal Code of Canada makes it a crime to touch , for a sexual purpose , any person under the age of 16 years . Section 153 then goes on to prohibit the sexual touching of a person under 18 by a person in three circumstances : if he or she is in a `` position of trust or authority '' towards the youth , if the youth is in a `` relationship of dependency '' with him or her , or if the relationship is `` exploitative '' . The term `` position of trust or authority '' is not defined in the Code but the courts have ruled that parents , teachers , and medical professionals hold a position of trust or authority towards youth they care for or teach . Section 153 ( 1.2 ) of the Code provides that a judge can infer whether or not a relationship is `` exploitative '' by considering its nature and circumstances including how old the youth is , the difference in ages between the partners , how the relationship evolved , and the degree of control or influence that the older partner has over the youth .",

        "question": "name the factor on which momentum of a body depends",
        "long_answer": "The first correct statement of the law of conservation of momentum was by English mathematician John Wallis in his 1670 work , Mechanica sive De Motu , Tractatus Geometricus : `` the initial state of the body , either of rest or of motion , will persist '' and `` If the force is greater than the resistance , motion will result '' . Wallis uses momentum and vis for force . Newton 's Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica , when it was first published in 1687 , showed a similar casting around for words to use for the mathematical momentum . His Definition II defines quantitas motus , `` quantity of motion '' , as `` arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly '' , which identifies it as momentum . Thus when in Law II he refers to mutatio motus , `` change of motion '' , being proportional to the force impressed , he is generally taken to mean momentum and not motion . It remained only to assign a standard term to the quantity of motion . The first use of `` momentum '' in its proper mathematical sense is not clear but by the time of Jenning 's Miscellanea in 1721 , five years before the final edition of Newton 's Principia Mathematica , momentum M or `` quantity of motion '' was being defined for students as `` a rectangle '' , the product of Q and V , where Q is `` quantity of material '' and V is `` velocity '' , s / t .",

        "long_answer": "This classification originated with the desert fathers , especially Evagrius Ponticus , who identified seven or eight evil thoughts or spirits that one needed to overcome . Evagrius ' pupil John Cassian , with his book The Institutes , brought the classification to Europe , where it became fundamental to Catholic confessional practices as evident in penitential manuals , sermons like `` The Parson 's Tale '' from Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales , and artworks like Dante 's Purgatory ( where the penitents of Mount Purgatory are depicted as being grouped and penanced according to the worst capital sin they committed ) . The Church used the doctrine of the deadly sins in order to help people stop their inclination towards evil before dire consequences and misdeeds occur ; the leader - teachers especially focused on pride ( which is thought to be the one that severs the soul from Grace , and one that is representative and the very essence of all evil ) and greed , both of which are seen as inherently sinful and as underlying all other sins ( although greed , when viewed just by itself and discounting all the sins it might lead to , is generally thought be less serious than sloth ) . To inspire people to focus on the seven deadly sins , the vices are discussed in treatises , and depicted in paintings and sculpture decorations on churches . Peter Brueghel the Elder 's prints of the Seven Deadly Sins and extremely numerous other works , both religious and non-religious , show the continuity of this practice in the culture and everyday life of the modern era .",

We can compare this with methane's volume and density.\n\nMethane has a boiling point of -161\u00b0C at one atmosphere (passage 1), while oxygen (a component of ozone) is gas at room temperature. Assuming similar behavior, we can conclude that both gases have approximately the same density under the same conditions since their molecular masses are close.\n\nTherefore, the density of ozone relative to methane is roughly equal."

Other possible sources , aside from Shakespeare 's imagination itself , include British folklore , such contemporary treatises on witchcraft as King James VI of Scotland 's Daemonologie , the Norns of Norse mythology , and ancient classical myths of the Fates : the Greek Moirai and the Roman Parcae .

However , the reality is that economic developers do not typically create jobs , but facilitate the process for existing businesses and start - ups to do so .

That could explain why the collapse was so widespread and able to render the Bronze Age civilizations incapable of recovery . The critical flaws of the Late Bronze Age are its centralisation , specialisation , complexity , and top - heavy political structure . These flaws then were exposed by sociopolitical events ( revolt of peasantry and defection of mercenaries ) , fragility of all kingdoms ( Mycenaean , Hittite , Ugaritic , and Egyptian ) , demographic crises ( overpopulation ) , and wars between states . Other factors that could have placed increasing pressure on the fragile kingdoms include interruption of maritime trade by piracy by the Sea Peoples , as well as drought , crop failure , famine , or the Dorian migration or invasion .",

The episode evoked criticism by the Broadcasting Standards Commission for its inclusion of `` almost relentless drunken and promiscuous behaviour , sexual innuendo and drug - taking , before the watershed '' , which included Mel having to kiss various strangers . The BBC defended the episode , claiming that its content would have `` come as no surprise to viewers '' and adding that the depiction of this behaviour conformed to an EastEnders tradition -- that questionable conduct `` only leads to further trouble ... One character 's quest for drugs led to embarrassment and nausea and a drinking binge led to the calling off of ( Barry and Natalie 's ) wedding while the prospects for ( Mel and Ian 's ) became bleaker .

This nucleotide is used to transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions . There is only a small amount of ATP in cells , but as it is continuously regenerated , the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day . ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism . Catabolism breaks down molecules , and anabolism puts them together . Catabolic reactions generate ATP , and anabolic reactions consume it .

Argentina 18 Bahamas 18 Barbados 18 Those aged 10 -- 17 are allowed to consume alcohol provided they are with a parent or guardian . Belize 18 Drinking age is rarely enforced . IDs are almost never requested . Bermuda 18 Bolivia 18 Brazil 18 British Virgin Islands 16 It is illegal to sell or to supply alcohol to anyone under the age of 16 . Canada 18 In Alberta , Manitoba and Quebec , the legal drinking age is 18 . 19 In Ontario , Saskatchewan , British Columbia , Newfoundland and Labrador , Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , Prince Edward Island , Northwest Territories , Yukon , and Nunavut , the legal drinking age is 19 . Cayman Islands 18 Chile 18 The minimum age is 18 to enter an enclosure that sells alcoholic beverages . Selling alcohol to a minor may incur a fine . One must provide identification upon request . Residents of Chile over the age of 18 must carry their Chilean identification card issued by the Civil Registry and Identification Service at all times . Colombia 18 Costa Rica 18 Cuba 16 Dominican Republic 18 Ecuador 18 El Salvador 18 Falkland Islands 18 Grenada 16 Guatemala 18 Guyana 18 Except 16 for wine or malt liquor to be consumed with a meal Haiti None Honduras 18 Jamaica None 18 Minors can drink if accompanied by parent or legal guardian as well as someone with permission from their parent or legal guardian . Mexico 18 A person must be eighteen years or over to legally purchase and consume alcoholic beverages in Mexico . The drinking age however is n't strictly enforced , and IDs are barely requested . Nicaragua 18 Panama 18 Paraguay 20 According to Art . 1 \u00b0 of the law to `` ban on the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors '' , it is illegal to serve or sell alcohol or to allow the consumption by minors under 20 years of age . Furthermore , under Art 2 \u00b0 all public establishments selling alcohol must display a clearly legible notice in the sales area with the following text : `` ESTA PROHIBIDA LA VENTA DE BEBIDAS ALCOH\u00d3LICAS A MENORES DE VEINTE A\u00d1OS DE EDAD '' ( It is illegal ( prohibited ) to sell alcoholic beverages to minors under 20 years of age ) Peru 18 Puerto Rico 18 The minimum age for the selling of any alcohol beverage is 18 . Although a valid Puerto Rico license ID or passport is required as proof of age to buyers who look under the age of 18 , it is generally not a common practice to ask for ID to enter a venue that sells alcohol or to sell you alcohol at other establishments . This law can be more enforced in some tourist areas and on foreigners visiting the island by some more exclusive hotels , bars , and upscale clubs . A few of the more exclusive venues in the tourist areas may have their own entrance rules regarding age including not allowing anyone under the age of 25 or 23 to enter and consume alcohol or change this depending on specific nights / events and restricted by gender / sex ( i.e. women over 18 allowed to enter but only men over 21 on that same night ) . Trinidad and Tobago 18 Turks and Caicos Islands 18 United States ( 50 states and integral territories ) Varies by jurisdiction 21 The National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 withholds revenue from states that allow the purchase of alcohol by anyone under the age of twenty - one . Prior to the effective date of that Act , the drinking age varied from state to state . Some states do not allow those under the legal drinking age to be present in liquor stores or in bars ( usually , the difference between a bar and a restaurant is that food is served only in the latter ) . Contrary to popular belief , since the act went into law , only a few states prohibit minors and young adults from consuming alcohol in private settings . As of January 1 , 2010 , fifteen states and the District of Columbia ban underage consumption outright , seventeen states do not ban underage consumption , and the remaining eighteen states have family member or location exceptions to their underage consumption laws . Federal law explicitly provides for religious exceptions . As of 2005 , thirty - one states have family member or location exceptions to their underage possession laws . However , non-alcoholic beer in many ( but not all ) states , such as Idaho , Texas , and Maryland , is considered legal for those under the age of twenty - one . By a judge 's ruling , South Carolina appears to allow the possession and consumption of alcohol by adults eighteen to twenty years of age , but a circuit court judge has said otherwise . The states of Washington and Wisconsin allows the consumption of alcohol in the presence of parents . Some U.S. states have legislation that make providing to and possession of alcohol by persons under twenty - one a gross misdemeanor with a potential penalty of a $5,000 fine or up to year in jail .

It opens anteriorly , through the isthmus faucium , into the mouth , while in its lateral wall , between the palatoglossal arch and the palatopharyngeal arch , is the palatine tonsil . The anterior wall consists of the base of the tongue and the epiglottic vallecula ; the lateral wall is made up of the tonsil , tonsillar fossa , and tonsillar ( faucial ) pillars ; the superior wall consists of the inferior surface of the soft palate and the uvula . Because both food and air pass through the pharynx , a flap of connective tissue called the epiglottis closes over the glottis when food is swallowed to prevent aspiration .

Typically , two men ( female hat tipping was rare ) would lift or tip their hats to each other , rather than exchange words of greeting . Where the ritual was used to emphasize social distance , the subordinate was obliged to make the more elaborate gesture , for example fully removing his hat while the superior merely touched his . The military hand salute is thought to have originated as a stylized hat tip ; while the civilian may return a salute via a hat tip . In its modern use , the hat tip has been replaced by the nod as a manner of respect . If one man gives another the nod , he should return in kind with either the casual nod up or the formal nod down .",

The band would live , write and rehearse at Deeves Hall , which was fully kitted out with the latest Marshall amplification . According to Simper , `` dozens '' of singers were auditioned ( including Rod Stewart and Woodman 's friend Dave Curtiss ) until the group heard Rod Evans of the club band The Maze , and thought his voice fit their style well . Tagging along with Evans was his band 's drummer , Ian Paice . Blackmore had seen Paice on tour with The Maze in Germany in 1966 , and had been impressed by the 18 - year - old 's drumming . The band hastily arranged an audition for Paice , given that Woodman was vocally unhappy with the direction of the band 's music . Both Paice and Evans won their respective jobs , and the line - up was complete .",

In the case that it is impossible to approach a Catholic minister , that it is a case of real need or spiritual benefit , and that the danger of error or indifferentism is avoided , the Catholic Church permits its faithful to receive Communion in Orthodox Churches , although Orthodox Churches do not honour this and only permit Orthodox Christians to receive Communion in Orthodox Churches . The Catholic Church does not ordinarily allow a Catholic to receive communion in a Protestant church , since it does not consider Protestant ministers to be priests ordained by bishops in a line of valid succession from the apostles , although Lutherans , Moravians , and Anglicans teach that they ordain their clergy in lines of apostolic succession . It applies this rule also to the Anglican Communion , pursuant to Apostolicae curae , a position that the Church of England disputed in Saepius officio .",

The temple , as well as many other buildings constructed by the Inca , incorporated aesthetics , underground water conduits , and hydraulic systems . The Inca understood water was needed for agricultural production ( used in terraces ) and for domestic purposes . The civil engineers of the time for the Inca were tasked with laying out diversion and canal routes to a designated spot , finding what water source would give the desired flow rate , and what elevation the water source would need to be tapped from for gravity to work effectively . Sanitation was also well known by the Inca . The Inca had their own wastewater treatment systems and it is documented that they would collect the human waste to perform land application to help ensure successful harvest seasons .",

        "long_answer": "After a few minutes , Mrs. Mallard gets up out of her chair and opens the door for Josephine and they both walk downstairs together . Upon arriving to the bottom of the staircase , the front door to Mrs. Mallard 's house began to unlock and open . It was Mrs. Mallard 's husband , Brently Mallard ! Alive and well . Mrs. Mallard was so immensely shocked at the sight of him that her poor , weak heart gave out right then and there . `` When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease -- of joy that kills '' . The cynicism of this sentence can be detected almost immediately , and as explained by ThoughtCo , `` It seems clear that her shock was not joy over her husband 's survival , but rather distress over losing her cherished , newfound freedom . Louise did briefly experience joy -- the joy of imagining herself in control of her own life . And it was the removal of that intense joy that led to her death . '' To further express the meaning of this `` joy '' , Selina S. Jamil explains in the article , `` Emotions in the Story of an Hour '' , `` ... the `` joy '' that kills Louise is the joy that ( doctors assume to be joy of finding out that Brently was not actually dead ) she refuses to surrender , as the patriarchy would require her to do at Brently 's return . But , for one climactic hour of her life , Louise does truly taste joy . For one hour of emotion , Louise does glimpse meaning and fulfillment . To be fully alive , then , is to engage in heightened consciousness , to observe and connect with the world around one 's self . '' This helps to show just how powerful the emotion was that Louise had felt . For one hour , Louise had a sense of freedom and was so ecstatic to begin her new life , but that was stripped away from her far too soon and her heart was unable to bear the shock that she felt about seeing her husband alive .",

A semi-automatic transmission offers a more direct connection between the engine and wheels than a manumatic and this responsiveness is preferred in high performance driving applications , while a manumatic is better for street use because its fluid coupling makes it easier for the transmission to consistently perform smooth shifts , and CVTs are generally found in gasoline - electric hybrid engine applications .",

After the UN involvement in the Korean War , the Soviet Union vetoed Lie 's reappointment in 1951 . The United States circumvented the Soviet Union 's veto and recommended reappointment directly to the General Assembly . Lie was reappointed by a vote of 46 to 5 , with eight abstentions . The Soviet Union remained hostile to Lie , and he resigned in 1952 .

After a series of candidates were vetoed , Hammarskj\u00f6ld emerged as an option that was acceptable to the Security Council . He was re-elected unanimously to a second term in 1957 . The Soviet Union was angered by Hammarskj\u00f6ld 's leadership of the UN during the Congo Crisis , and suggested that the position of Secretary - General be replaced by a troika , or three - man executive . Facing great opposition from the Western nations , the Soviet Union gave up on its suggestion . Hammarskj\u00f6ld died in a plane crash in Northern Rhodesia ( now Zambia ) in 1961 . U.S. President John F. Kennedy called Hammarskj\u00f6ld `` the greatest statesman of our century '' .

In the process of replacing Hammarskj\u00f6ld , the developing world insisted on a non-European and non-American Secretary - General . U Thant was nominated . However , due to opposition from the French ( Thant had chaired a committee on Algerian independence ) and the Arabs ( Burma supported Israel ) , Thant was only appointed for the remainder of Hammarskj\u00f6ld 's term . He was the first Asian Secretary - General . The following year , on 30 November , Thant was unanimously re-elected to a new term ending on 3 November 1966 .

Waldheim launched a discreet but effective campaign to become the Secretary - General .

In 1976 , China initially blocked Waldheim 's re-election , but it relented on the second ballot . In 1981 , Waldheim 's re-election for a third term was blocked by China , which vetoed his selection through 15 rounds . From 1986 to 1992 , Waldheim served as President of Austria , making him the first former Secretary - General to rise to the position of head of state .

The Security Council conducted five anonymous straw polls -- a first for the council -- and Boutros - Ghali emerged with 11 votes on the fifth round . In 1996 , the United States vetoed the re-appointment of Boutros - Ghali , claiming he had failed in implementing necessary reforms to the UN . 7 Kofi Annan ( born 1938 ) 1 January 1997 -- 31 December 2006 Ghana African Retired after two full terms .

        "long_answer": "In the 1969 -- 70 season , women 's collegiate basketball ( at the time sanctioned by the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women ) used a 30 - second shot clock on an experimental basis , officially adopting it for the 1970 -- 71 season . Unlike the women 's side , there was initial resistance to the implementation of a shot clock for men 's NCAA basketball , due to fears that smaller colleges would be unable to compete with powerhouses in a running game . However , after extreme results like an 11 -- 6 Tennessee win over Temple in 1973 , support for a men 's shot clock began to build . The NCAA introduced a 45 - second shot clock for the men 's game in the 1985 -- 86 season , reducing it to 35 seconds in the 1993 -- 94 season and 30 seconds in the 2015 -- 16 season .

It was originally written `` 4 - 4 - 2 '' ( with badging showing hyphens between the numerals ) , and remained hyphenated throughout Oldsmobile 's use of the designation . Beginning in 1965 , the 4 - 4 - 2s standard transmission was a 3 speed manual along with optional 2 speed automatic or 4 speed manual , but were still badged as `` 4 - 4 - 2 '' s . By 1968 badging was shortened to simply `` 442 '' , but Oldsmobile brochures and internal documents continued to use the `` 4 - 4 - 2 '' model designation .",

        "long_answer": "Early research on the role of antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats , which is the cause of rancidity . Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption . However , it was the identification of vitamins A , C , and E as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms . The possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized . Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions , often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells .",

        "long_answer": "Terminal cisternae are enlarged areas of the sarcoplasmic reticulum surrounding the transverse tubules . These discrete regions within the muscle cell store calcium ( increasing the capacity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ) and release it when an action potential courses down the transverse tubules , eliciting muscle contraction . Because terminal cisternae ensure rapid calcium delivery , they are well developed in muscles that contract quickly , such as fast twitch skeletal muscle . Terminal cisternae then go on to release calcium , which binds to troponin . This releases tropomyosin , exposing active sites of the thin filament , actin .",

        "long_answer": "In Germany , the use of the flag and other national symbols has been relatively low for most of the time since the Second World War -- a reaction against the widespread use of flags by the Nazi Party and against the nationalistic furor of the Nazis in general . During the 2006 FIFA World Cup , which took place in Germany , public use of the national flag increased dramatically . Although this explosion in the flag 's popularity was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of surprise and apprehension , the decades - old fear that German flag - waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed by the end of the tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike .",

As with Darabont , each had been given a certain percentage of the show 's profits based on if the show was produced by a third - party , but when it was transitioned to AMC Studios , their share was dramatically reduced . The Hollywood Reporter estimated that if the four seek similar damages as Darabont , the lawsuit could be as high as $1 billion . The suits , filed separately in Los Angeles and New York City , will be consolidated into a single case to be heard in a California court . Kirkman and the others said that despite the lawsuit , they will continue to work as `` partners '' with AMC to assure continued success of The Walking Dead and its spinoff series Fear the Walking Dead .",

The actinide series comprises the elements from actinium to lawrencium .

Abstention or absence from the vote by a permanent member does not prevent a draft resolution from being adopted . However , the veto power does not apply to `` procedural '' votes , as determined by the permanent members themselves . The permanent members can vote against a `` procedural '' draft resolution without blocking its adoption by the Council . A negative vote by a permanent member will also block the selection of a Secretary - General , although this is a `` recommendation '' to the General Assembly rather than a Resolution . The unconditional veto posessed by the five governments has been seen by critics as the most undemocratic character of the UN . Critics also claim that veto power is the main cause for international inaction on war crimes and crimes against humanity . However , the United States refused to join the United Nations unless it was given a veto . The absence of the United States from the League of Nations contributed to its ineffectiveness .",

        "question": "how long did it take to get to australia on the first fleet",
        "long_answer": "13 May 1787 -- The 11 ships of the First Fleet leave Portsmouth under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip . Different accounts give varying numbers of passengers but the fleet consisted of at least 1,350 persons of whom 780 were convicts and 570 were free men , women and children and the number included four companies of marines . About 20 % of the convicts were women and the oldest convict was 82 . About 50 % of the convicts had been tried in Middlesex and most of the rest were tried in the county assizes of Devon , Kent and Sussex 18 January 1788 -- The First Fleet arrived in Botany Bay but the landing party was not impressed with the site , and moved the fleet to Port Jackson , landing in Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788 ( now celebrated as Australia Day ) April 1789 -- A suspicious outbreak of smallpox decimates local tribes . Research by Michael J Bennett published in 2009 , corroborated independently by Christopher Warren in 2013 , demonstrates this outbreak was most likely deliberate . 1790 -- the Second Fleet of convicts arrives in Sydney Cove . 1791 -- Third Fleet of convicts arrives 1793 -- January : the first free settlers arrive in NSW . 1793 -- March -- April : visit of the expedition led by Alessandro Malaspina . 1825 - May : Founding of Brisbane 14 June 1825 -- the colony of Van Diemen 's Land is established in its own right ; its name is officially changed to Tasmania on 1 January 1856 . The first settlement was made at Risdon , Tasmania on 11 September 1803 when Lieut John Bowen landed with about 50 settlers , crew , soldiers and convicts . The site proved unsuitable and was abandoned in August 1804 . Lieut - Col David Collins finally established a successful settlement at Hobart in February 1804 with a party of about 260 people , including 178 convicts . ( Collins had previously attempted a settlement in Victoria . ) Convict ships were sent from England directly to the colony from 1812 to 1853 and over the 50 years from 1803 -- 1853 around 67,000 convicts were transported to Tasmania . About 14,492 were Irish but many of them had been sentenced in English and Scottish courts . Some were also tried locally in other Australian colonies . The Indefatigable brought the first convicts direct from England on 19 October 1812 and by 1820 there were about 2,500 convicts in the colony . By the end of 1833 the number had increased to 14,900 convicts of whom 1864 were females . About 1,448 held ticket of leave , 6,573 were assigned to settlers and 275 were recorded as `` absconded or missing '' . In 1835 there were over 800 convicts working in chain - gangs at the penal station at Port Arthur which operated from 1830 to 1877 . Convicts were transferred to Van Diemen 's Land from Sydney and , in later years , from 1841 to 1847 , from Melbourne . Between 1826 and 1840 , there were at least 19 ship loads of convicts sent from Van Diemen 's Land to Norfolk Island and at other times they were sent from Norfolk Island to Van Diemen 's Land . 21 January 1827 -- Western Australia was established when a small British settlement was established at King George 's Sound ( Albany ) by Major Edmund Lockyer who was to provide a deterrent to the French presence in the area . On 18 June 1829 the new Swan River Colony was officially proclaimed with Captain James Stirling as the first Governor . Except for the settlement at King George 's Sound , the colony was never really a part of NSW . King George 's Sound was handed over in 1831 . In 1849 the colony was proclaimed a British penal settlement and the first convicts arrived in 1850 . Rottnest Island , off the coast of Perth , became the colony 's convict settlement in 1838 and was used for local colonial offenders . Around 9,720 British convicts were sent directly to the colony in 43 ships between 1850 and 1868 . The convicts were sought by local settlers because of the shortage of labour needed to develop the region . On 9 January 1868 , Australia 's last convict ship , the Hougoumont brought its final cargo of 269 convicts . Convicts sent to Western Australia were sentenced to terms of 6 , 7 , 10 , 14 and 15 years and some reports suggest that their literacy rate was around 75 % as opposed to 50 % for those sent to NSW and Tasmania . About a third of the convicts left the Swan River Colony after serving their time . 1835 -- the Proclamation of Governor Bourke , issued by the Colonial Office and sent to the Governor with Despatch 99 of 10 October 1835 , implements the doctrine of terra nullius upon which British settlement was based . Reinforcing the British assertion that the land belonged to no one prior to the British Crown taking possession of it , it effectively quashes pre-existing treaties with Aboriginal peoples ( e.g. that signed by John Batman ) . Its publication in the Colony means that from then on , all people found occupying land without the authority of the government would be considered illegal trespassers . Aboriginal people therefore could not sell or assign the land , nor could an individual person acquire it , other than through distribution by the Crown . 28 December 1836 -- the British province of South Australia was established . In 1842 it became a crown colony and on 22 July 1861 its area was extended westwards to its present boundary and more area was taken from New South Wales . South Australia was never a British convict colony and between 1836 -- 1840 about 13,400 immigrants arrived in the area . 24,900 more arrived between 1841 -- 1850 . Some escaped convicts did settle in the area and no doubt a number of ex-convicts moved there from other colonies . On 4 January 1837 Governor Hindmarsh proclaimed that any offenders convicted in South Australia , and being under sentence of transportation , were to be transported to either New South Wales or Van Diemens Land , by the first opportunity . 1841 -- New Zealand is separated from New South Wales 1851 -- Victoria is separated from New South Wales ( formerly known as the Port Phillip District of NSW ) . Apart from castaways and runaway convicts in the 1790s , the first attempt at settlement was made on 13 October 1803 by Lieut . David Collins and his party of soldiers and convicts . Harsh conditions convinced him to abandon the settlement in January 1804 . He moved on to Tasmania and it was not until the Henty brothers landed in Portland Bay on 19 November 1834 and John Batman settled on the site of Melbourne that the Port Phillip District was officially sanctioned on 10 April 1837 . The first immigrant ships arrived at Port Phillip in 1839 . Apart from those involved in early attempts at settlement in 1803 and 1826 , the only convicts sent directly to Victoria from Britain were about 1,750 convicts known as the `` Exiles '' and they arrived between 1844 -- 1849 . They were sometimes called the `` Pentonvillians '' because most of them came from Pentonville Probationary Prison in England . Many ex-convicts and convicts on Tickets of Leave and Conditional Pardons also moved to Port Phillip from Van Diemen 's Land . 10 December 1859 -- Queensland is separated from New South Wales . In 1824 the explorer Lieut . John Oxley took a party of 30 convicts and established a penal colony at Redcliffe . Known as the Moreton Bay Settlement , this later moved to the site now called Brisbane . The name Brisbane Town was in use by 1825 and the main inhabitants in the area were the convicts of the Moreton Bay Penal Station until it was closed in 1839 . Around 2,280 convicts were sent to the settlement between 1824 -- 1839 and at the end of 1836 the convict population numbered 337 . The first free settlers moved to the district in 1838 and others followed in 1840 . 23 December 1862 -- the area of Queensland is increased . 1863 -- control of the Northern Territory is granted to the Province ( later State ) of South Australia . In 1825 the area occupied today by Northern Territory was incorporated into the colony of New South Wales . It was first settled by Europeans in 1824 at Fort Dundas , Port Essington . Its capital city , Darwin was established in 1869 and was originally known as Palmerston . On 1 January 1911 , the Northern Territory as we know it today was separated from South Australia and became part of the Commonwealth of Australia . 1 January 1901 -- the Federation of Australian States to form the Commonwealth of Australia . 1911 -- The ACT is established .",

        "long_answer": "From 1976 to 1983 , several states voluntarily raised their purchase ages to 19 ( or , less commonly , 20 or 21 ) , in part to combat drunk driving fatalities . In 1984 , Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act , which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10 % of their federal highway funds . By mid-1988 , all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 ( but not Puerto Rico , Guam , or the Virgin Islands , see Additional Notes below ) . South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate . The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans , because of it being higher than the age of majority ( 18 in most states ) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries . The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a congressional sidestep of the tenth amendment . Although debates have not been highly publicized , a few states have proposed legislation to lower their drinking age , while Guam has raised its drinking age to 21 in July 2010 .",

        "question": "where is the ball kicked off from in football",
        "long_answer": "The line where the ball is placed for kickoff varies among the rule books . It is placed on the kicking team 's 30 - yard line in six - man football , 35 - yard line in college and professional outdoor football , 40 - yard line in American high school football , 45 - yard line in amateur Canadian football , and the goal line in indoor and arena football . For the 2016 season only , the Ivy League placed the ball on the 40 - yard line in conference games . All players on the kicking team except the kicker ( and , if used , a holder ) must not cross the line at which the ball is placed until the ball is kicked . The receiving team must stay behind the line that is 10 yards from where the ball is placed . The ball can be fielded by the receiving team at any point after it has been kicked , or by the kicking team after it has traveled 10 yards or has been touched by a member of the receiving team . In American football ( but not Canadian ) touchback and fair catch rules apply to the kicked ball . If it is fielded by the kicking team , it is called an onside kick . A low , bouncing kick is called a squib kick . Although a squib kick typically gives the receiving team better field position than they would if a normal kick had been used , a squib kick is sometimes used to avoid giving up a long return , as well as use up a valuable amount of time on the clock , as it is impossible to fair catch such a kick . It is usually done when a team takes the lead in the final seconds , and is done to safely run out the remainder of the clock . Squib kicking with more than 20 seconds remaining has had unfortunate results ( a line drive kick is more common when there are 20 to 50 seconds remaining ; the typical hurry - up offense drive takes over a minute ) , but has been done by some teams .",

The website 's consensus states , `` Marvel 's Inhumans sets a new low standard for the MCU with an unimaginative narrative , dull design work , weak characters , and disengaging soapy melodrama . '' Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned a score of 27 out of 100 based on 20 reviews , indicating `` generally unfavorable reviews '' . Reviews for the first two episodes that released in IMAX were mainly negative from critics . In his review of the first episodes , TVLine 's Matt Webb Mitovich said , `` If the pace and ingenuity ( from the second half ) continues to ramp up , Inhumans , with just six more episodes to go , could prove to be a serviceable Marvel ' event ' series -- though maybe not enough so that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. fans will forgive that series ' delayed return . '' Brian Lowry of CNN noted , `` If the eight - episode Inhumans fails , it could shine a spotlight on the fact Marvel has generally lagged behind '' Warner Bros.

'' Roger Ebert commended the stories involving Woodard and Capshaw 's characters for being the most heartfelt but found the rest of them devoid of any emotional resonance compared to the tales told in the film adaptation of Amy Tan 's The Joy Luck Club , saying that they have lives `` largely recycled from sweet movies and tasteful romantic novels . '' Eve Zibart of The Washington Post said that despite Bancroft 's performance being `` right on the ceiling '' in terms of over the top and saying that Ryder `` seems for once to be acting , and not entirely comfortably '' , she praised the rest of the actresses for being `` theatrical indulgence by a cast of stahs .

One suggestion is that the phrase refers to the whip - like `` cat o'nine tails '' , an instrument of punishment once used on Royal Navy vessels . The instrument was purportedly stored in a red sack , and a sailor who revealed the transgressions of another would be `` letting the cat out of the bag '' . Another suggested derivation is from the `` pig in a poke '' scam , where a customer buying a suckling pig in a sack would actually be sold a ( less valuable ) cat , and would not realise the deception until the bag was opened . Johannes Agricola made reference to the expression `` let the cat out of the bag '' in a letter to Martin Luther on the 4th May 1530 as referenced in Lyndal Roper 's 2016 biography about Mart\u00edn Luther .",

        "long_answer": "The mechanism of water oxidation is still not fully elucidated , but we know many details about this process . The oxidation of water to molecular oxygen requires extraction of four electrons and four protons from two molecules of water . The experimental evidence that oxygen is released through cyclic reaction of oxygen evolving complex ( OEC ) within one PSII was provided by Pierre Joliot et al. They have shown that , if dark - adapted photosynthetic material ( higher plants , algae , and cyanobacteria ) is exposed to a series of single turnover flashes , oxygen evolution is detected with typical period - four damped oscillation with maxima on the third and the seventh flash and with minima on the first and the fifth flash ( for review , see ) . Based on this experiment , Bessel Kok and co-workers introduced a cycle of five flash - induced transitions of the so - called S - states , describing the four redox states of OEC : When four oxidizing equivalents have been stored ( at the S - state ) , OEC returns to its basic S - state . In the absence of light , the OEC will `` relax '' to the S state ; the S state is often described as being `` dark - stable '' . The S state is largely considered to consist of manganese ions with oxidation states of Mn , Mn , Mn , Mn . Finally , the intermediate S - states were proposed by Jablonsky and Lazar as a regulatory mechanism and link between S - states and tyrosine Z .",

The interests of the agency 's constituency ( the interest groups ) are met , while the needs of consumers ( which may be the general public ) are passed over . That public administration may result in benefiting a small segment of the public in this way may be viewed as problematic for the popular concept of democracy if the general welfare of all citizens is sacrificed for very specific interests . This is especially so if the legislation passed neglects or reverses the original purpose for which the agency was established . Some maintain that such arrangements are consonant with ( and are natural outgrowths of ) the democratic process , since they frequently involve a majority block of voters implementing their will through their representatives in government .",

        "long_answer": "Because there are no permanent human settlements south of the Antarctic Circle , apart from research stations , the countries and territories whose populations experience the midnight sun are limited to those crossed by the Arctic Circle : the Canadian Yukon , Nunavut , and Northwest Territories , and the nations of Iceland , Finland , Norway , Sweden , Denmark ( Greenland ) , Russia , and the State of Alaska in the United States . A quarter of Finland 's territory lies north of the Arctic Circle , and at the country 's northernmost point the sun does not set at all for 60 days during summer . In Svalbard , Norway , the northernmost inhabited region of Europe , there is no sunset from approximately 19 April to 23 August . The extreme sites are the poles , where the sun can be continuously visible for half the year . The North Pole has midnight sun for 6 months from late March to late September .",
