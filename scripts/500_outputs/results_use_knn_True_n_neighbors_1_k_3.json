However, according to Forbes' 2018 list, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook are tied with a combined salary of $54.2 million for the 2017-2018 season.\n\n## Step 4: Determine who earned the highest annual salary in the NBA.\nBased on the information from step 3, Kevin Durant is reported to have earned more than LeBron James ($26 million) and Russell Westbrook ($28 million), making him the player with the highest total annual salary in the NBA for 2018.\n\n## Step 5: Determine who was the most paid nba player 2018.\nBased on Forbes' 2018 list, Kevin Durant earns $24.59 million per year which is not correct since I calculated his salary to be $19.285 million, so it's actually Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook who earned a combined total of $54.2 million for the 2017-2018 season.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the player with the highest annual salary in the NBA for 2018.\nKevin Durant earns more than Russell Westbrook making him the correct answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Kevin Durant}$",
