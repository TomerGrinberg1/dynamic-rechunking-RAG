It comes from the Latin word \"ramus,\" meaning branch or stem, and is derived from the Arabic word \"ram\u012bd,\" which means \"branch.\" In medieval times, surnames were often based on a person's occupation, place of origin, or personal characteristics.\n\nIn this case, the surname \"Ram\u00edrez\" may have originated as a patronymic surname, meaning that it was formed by adding the suffix \"-ez\" or \"-\u00e9s\" to the father's name. In other words, someone who had a son named Ram\u00edrez would be called \"Ram\u00edrez\" (son of Ram\u00edrez).\n\nThe surname \"Ram\u00edrez\" is also believed to have been influenced by the Arabic word \"ram\u012bd,\" which was used in the Middle Ages to describe branches or stems that were attached to the trunk of a tree. This may have led to the use of \"Ram\u00edrez\" as a surname among Muslims and other groups who arrived in Europe from the Middle East.\n\nThroughout history, the surname \"Ram\u00edrez\" has been found not only in Spain but also in many countries in Central and South America, as well as in the Caribbean. Today, it is one of the most common surnames in Mexico, where it originated, as well as in other Spanish-speaking countries such as Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela.\n\nIn summary, the surname \"Ram\u00edrez\" is of Spanish origin and has its roots in medieval surnames based on occupation, place of origin, or personal characteristics.",

However, this does not account for silver and bronze medals that may be included in their overall total.\n\n## Step 4: Review the overall medal counts of athletes with 13 gold medals or more.\nAthletes like Larisa Latynina (6 gold, 14 total) and Paavo Nurmi (7 gold, 9 total) come close to Phelps' count but do not exceed it. Other notable athletes with multiple golds include Usain Bolt (6 gold), Bj\u00f8rn D\u00e6hlie (6 gold), Sawao Kato (5 gold), and Nadia Com\u0103neci (5 gold).\n\n## Step 5: Note the athlete with a total of more than 13 medals.\nAmong those who have won at least 13 golds, Usain Bolt stands out for his incredible achievement in multiple Olympic Games.\n\n## Step 6: Consider athletes who may be missed or overlooked due to incomplete information or different criteria used to determine their medal counts.\nIn this case, we're focusing on the question's specific request regarding individual medals and their count. The key figure mentioned is Michael Phelps, indicating that we should focus only on his total count of gold medals.\n\n## Step 7: Confirm that there are no other athletes who have won more than 13 golds, given the constraints of the problem.\nGiven the emphasis on individual achievements and without access to an exhaustive list or updated information beyond what's provided in the question, we rely on established records to answer the question accurately.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Michael Phelps}$",

However, candela is a dimensionless quantity and can be expressed in terms of watts per square meter (W/m^2).\n\n## Step 4: Express candela in Watts per square meter (W/m^2).\nSince I v = 683 \u22c5 y \u0304 (\u03bb) \u22c5 I e , we can rewrite this as candelas W/m^2. This is the SI unit of luminous intensity.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the question about units of temperature.\nThe question is asking for the SI unit of temperature.\n\n## Step 6: Recall the definition of Kelvin (K).\nThermodynamic temperature, or Kelvin temperature, is defined as K = \u0398 kelvin (K).\n\n## Step 7: Identify the unit for thermodynamic temperature.\nSince it's a thermodynamic quantity, we can consider its base units. The Kelvin (K) is derived from Celsius (\u00b0C) and Fahrenheit (\u00b0F), but in SI, the base unit for thermodynamic temperature is not explicitly defined as W/m^2\u00b7sr.\n\n## Step 8: Express thermodynamic temperature in Kelvin (K).\nThe standard representation of thermodynamic temperature as a dimensionless quantity can be expressed using the kelvin scale.",
