        "llm_response": "No Woman, No Cry is a song written and recorded by Bob Marley. The lyrics describe the struggles of life in poverty and the longing for freedom and spiritual connection. The song's chorus repeats the phrase \"I go to the bottom\" which suggests a sense of despair and desperation.\n\nThe song is often interpreted as an expression of social justice, advocating for equality and fairness in a society plagued by inequality and oppression. Marley's lyrics also touch on themes of love, unity, and empowerment, with some interpretations suggesting that the song can be seen as a call to action against racism and injustice.\n\nAdditionally, the song has been interpreted as a personal reflection on Marley's own experiences growing up in Trenchtown, Kingston, Jamaica, and his feelings about the struggles he faced there.",
