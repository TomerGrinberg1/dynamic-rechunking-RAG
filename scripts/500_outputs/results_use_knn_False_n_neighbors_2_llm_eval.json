Some notable examples include:\n\n* Larry Bird (38 points) - Boston Celtics vs Chicago Bulls\n* Michael Jordan (38 points) - Chicago Bulls vs Washington Wizards\n* Dirk Nowitzki (37 points) - Dallas Mavericks vs Denver Nuggets\n* Wilt Chamberlain (54 points) - Philadelphia Warriors vs New York Knicks\n\n## Step 2: Determine the player with the most points in a single NBA game\nAll of these players have achieved this feat, but we need to identify which one had the most. Let's look at some of their performances:\n\n- Larry Bird's record is tied by Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain.\n- Dirk Nowitzki's 37 points are not among the top three in the single-game scoring categories.\n\n## Step 3: Check if there were any games with more than one player having 40+ points\nYes, it was Larry Bird vs Chicago Bulls (38) which had the most players with over 30 but also Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain tied for a record of 38 in a game. Then we look at Dirk Nowitzki who scored 37 points.\n\n## Step 4: Identify all the games that include these numbers\nFrom our previous steps, the following games have these numbers: 1983 San Antonio Spurs vs Denver Nuggets (285), 1990 Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks (280), and 1967 Oakland\u2013 Alameda County Coliseum Arena Oakland, California San Francisco Warriors (279).\n\n## Step 5: Compare all the points\nThe player who scored the most points in one NBA basketball game is Michael Jordan, with a total of 38 points.",

The speech was broadcast on television around the world, and it marked the beginning of the US-led invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe invasion began with a series of airstrikes against Iraqi military targets, including airbases and command centers.

However, it also states that in the texts of Jainism, the Hindu god Krishna is stated to be a cousin of Neminatha.\n\n## Step 3: Recall the tradition of naming Tirthankaras.\nIn some traditions, the 23rd Tirthankara of Jainism is considered to be Shantibhadra, but based on the information provided in the passage, it seems there was a mistake or an error regarding this traditional knowledge. \n\n## Step 4: Review the final information from the passage again.\nThe correct information about the Tirthankaras mentioned in the passage does not explicitly mention any of these names as being specifically related to the 23rd Tirthankara.\n\n## Step 5: Provide a correction for the specific question asked based on available data.\nBased on the provided information and typical Jain traditions, we cannot accurately answer which one is specifically referred to as the 23rd Tirthankara. However, if we have to choose from known figures mentioned in the text (Parshvanatha, Neminatha) or commonly recognized figures such as Shantibhadra who could be considered nearsighted towards a position that aligns more closely with historical records, one must deduce based on available knowledge.\n\n## Step 6: Deduction for the question.\nGiven the context of Jain traditions and considering possible confusion in the passage's details about Tirthankaras, if we have to select from provided options or infer within known figures mentioned, it appears that no figure is explicitly named as the 23rd Tirthankara. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Shantibhadra}$",

        "llm_response": "The song \"Closer\" by Nine Inch Nails is a complex and open-to-interpretation song, but its meaning can be broken down into several themes and ideas. Here are some possible interpretations:\n\n1. **Obsession**: The song's chorus, \"I wanna fuck you like an animal,\" suggests a desire for intense, all-consuming sex. This could represent the narrator's obsessive nature, his need to be in control, or his desire to break free from societal norms.\n2. **Control and power**: The lyrics also contain references to feeling trapped and helpless (\"You're my slave\"), which can be seen as a metaphor for feelings of oppression or submission. This theme may be linked to the narrator's struggle with emotions and desires.\n3. **Darkness and chaos**: The song features prominent industrial and electronic elements, which can evoke a sense of darkness, anxiety, and desperation. These themes may represent the narrator's inner turmoil and emotional state.\n4. **Unrequited love**: Some interpretations suggest that the song is about an unrequited or doomed love affair. The lyrics \"I wanna fuck you like an animal\" could be seen as a metaphor for the desire to possess or control someone, even if it means losing them.\n5. **Existential crisis**: Another interpretation is that the song is a reflection of the narrator's existential crisis, where he struggles with his own mortality and the meaninglessness of life. The lyrics \"You're my slave\" could be seen as a metaphor for feelings of helplessness in the face of existence.\n\nOverall, \"Closer\" by Nine Inch Nails is a complex and deeply personal song that can be interpreted in many ways. Its themes of obsession, control, darkness, unrequited love, and existential crisis continue to fascinate listeners and inspire new interpretations.\n\n**Additional interpretation:** Some fans have also speculated about the song's connection to the narrator's real-life experiences or relationships, suggesting that it may be inspired by a specific person or event in his life. For example, one theory is that the song is about his relationship with Mayte Garcia, an American singer and model who was involved in a high-profile scandal. However, this interpretation remains speculative and not officially confirmed.\n\nIt's worth noting that Trent Reznor, the lead singer and songwriter of Nine Inch Nails, has intentionally avoided giving definitive answers to these questions, leaving the meaning of \"Closer\" open to individual interpretation.",

Marley has stated that he was using the song as a metaphor for the pain and heartache that can come from lost love or infidelity.\n\nIt's worth noting that Marley's intentions were never about promoting feminism or women's rights specifically, but rather about exploring complex emotions and relationships through music.

It refers to an anonymous or unknown woman.\n\nOver time, these names have been formalized and incorporated into modern law, particularly in civil cases where an individual is being sued by someone else. The name John Doe/ Jane Doe serves as a default placeholder for individuals who are not directly involved in the lawsuit, such as witnesses, experts, or parties with limited knowledge of the case.\n\nThe use of these names continues to be relevant today due to their widespread adoption and recognition in various legal systems around the world.",
