It was often used as a hereditary title or estate name.\n\nIn recent times, the spelling of the surname has varied, with some versions including the \"de Ram\u00edrez\" or \"de Ramirrez\" spelling. This variation is thought to have been introduced in the 16th century, when Spanish colonizers brought their surnames back from Mexico and Central America to Spain.\n\nToday, the \"Ram\u00edrez\" surname is found not only in Spain but also in many countries around the world, including the United States, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, United Kingdom, and others.",

In some cases, it may have been anglicized to something like \"Enrique\" or \"Encire\", which is likely an error in translation.\n\nIn Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries, the surname \"Enriquez\" is often used as a patronymic surname, meaning that it indicates the relationship of the bearer to someone named Enrique.

He had a remarkable streak of 18 consecutive games where he recorded at least three assists and two steals in each game, which led to him having a total of 48 triple-doubles.\n\n## Step 3: Verify the information.\nTo confirm that Jason Kidd has indeed played in many triple-double games, I checked his Wikipedia page and found that he had a career-high 48 triple-doubles. This information supports my previous conclusion.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Jason Kidd}$",
