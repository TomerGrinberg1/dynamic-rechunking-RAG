However, it's worth noting that the question also mentions Eastern Orthodoxy and classical Anglicanism, which may have distinct understandings of eschatological fulfillment.\n\n## Step 4: Conclude based on the provided context\nSince the question asks about who is given the special gift of infallibility without specifying a particular tradition or denomination, it seems to be seeking an answer that applies broadly across different religious contexts.

Here are some possible sources:\n\n*   **Basque Country**: The Basque people have a long history in Spain and France, where they settled in the Pyrenees region. They introduced their own language (Euskara), culture, and surname \"Ram\u00edrez\" which is believed to be derived from the Basque word \"ramiz\", meaning \"hill\" or \"slope\".\n*   **Iberian Peninsula**: The Ram\u00edrez surname may also have originated in the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Spain. In medieval times, the name was used to identify people with a specific geographic location.\n*   **Latin American Influence**: After Spanish colonization, many Basque settlers moved to Latin America and brought their language and culture with them. Over time, the Ram\u00edrez surname became more widespread throughout the Americas.\n\nThe spelling \"Ram\u00edrez\" has undergone significant changes over the centuries, and it's now commonly found in various countries, including Spain, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and others.",

Over time, the name became a personal surname, and it has been passed down through generations of families in these countries.\n\nIn many cases, people with the surname Enriquez can trace their ancestry back to medieval times, specifically to the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n in northern Spain. From there, they migrated to other parts of Europe, including Portugal, Italy, and eventually, the Americas.\n\nIt's worth noting that the spelling and pronunciation of surnames have varied over time and across different regions, so \"Enriquez\" may be spelled differently in various countries or dialects.",

However, only one is specifically referred to as the King of the Seven Kingdoms at some point during the seventh season.\n\n## Step 3: Look for information about the Kings in Season 7.\nSeason 7 introduces new characters such as Bran Stark and his family members, who become the new rulers of the realm after the death of Daenerys Targaryen. However, there is no direct mention of a king specifically named in Season 7.\n\n## Step 4: Consider Bran Stark's role.\nBran Stark becomes King Robert Baratheon when he marries Cersei Lannister at the end of Season 6 and then abdicates to rule as a separate entity. However, this is not the same as being recognized as king by his people or ruling over the Seven Kingdoms.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the actual ruler in Season 7.\nSince Bran Stark does not become the King of the Seven Kingdoms directly, but rather rules independently for a time and then becomes Robert Baratheon, we must look elsewhere. The person who is recognized as king by his people or officially recognized as such during Season 7 is actually Daenerys Targaryen's brother Jon Snow, but more specifically, it was Cersei's plans to claim the Iron Throne that are highlighted in this season.\n\n## Step 6: Consider Cersei Lannister's ultimate goal.\nCersei Lannister's ultimate plan for power and her intentions during Season 7 are what lead to significant events in the series. She aims to reclaim the Iron Throne, which has been passed down through the Targaryen dynasty.\n\n## Step 7: Identify who ultimately becomes king of Westeros after Cersei's plans come to fruition.\nIn the context of Cersei's plan and its ultimate execution, it is Jon Snow (Aegon Targaryen) who technically becomes the King in the North at one point before he realizes his true identity as Aegon Targaryen, but ultimately also ends up being declared king by the people of the Seven Kingdoms after Bran Stark's ascension to the Iron Throne for the sake of unity and to bring an end to the conflict.\n\n## Step 8: Correctly identify the actual King of Westeros at the end of Season 7.\nThis brings us back to Daenerys Targaryen as the one who, through her plan, becomes the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms with the support of Jon Snow. However, Bran Stark's ascension later proves that Daenerys is not truly king and that the Iron Throne was intended for Bran after she ruled.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Daenerys Targaryen}$",
