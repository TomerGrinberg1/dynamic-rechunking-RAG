This concept is often associated with the Christian understanding of faith.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the passage\nFrom a theological perspective, fear of the Lord refers to a sense of respect, awe, and submission towards God, which can encompass more than simple fear. The passages suggest that it's not about being afraid but rather a joyful awareness of God's grandeur and gratitude for finding peace in Him.\n\n## Step 3: Drawing conclusions\nGiven the context and analysis, \"fear of the Lord\" is likely referring to a deep reverence and respect for God as the source of guidance, protection, and ultimate peace. This concept encompasses more than simple fear but aims to cultivate a joyful relationship with God.\n\nThe final answer is: Deep respect and awe towards God as a source of guidance, protection, and ultimate peace.",

However, it mentions that the US$4,600,000,000 was used as a reference point for comparison with other Olympic costs.\n\n## Step 1: Identify relevant information\nThe passage mentions several Olympic events hosted by different cities, including Rio de Janeiro (2016), Pyeongchang (2018), Tokyo (2020), Beijing (2022), Paris (2024), Los Angeles (2028), and others. It also lists the costs for each of these events.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the costs\nThe costs mentioned in the passage are:\n- Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics 2016: US$11.6 billion\n- Pyeongchang Winter Olympics 2018: Not explicitly stated, but likely around the same range as other winter Olympics (US$10 billion)\n- Tokyo Summer Olympics 2020: US$4 billion\n- Beijing Winter Olympics 2022: Not explicitly stated, but likely around the same range as other winter Olympics (USD $100 billion)\n- Paris Summer Olympics 2024: Not explicitly stated, but likely around the same range as other summer Olympics (TBD)\n- Los Angeles Summer Olympics 2028: Not explicitly stated\n- Sochi Winter Olympics 2014: CDN$51.3 million\n- Calgary Winter Olympics 1988: CDN$43.9 million\n- Seoul Summer Olympics 1988: USD $300 million\n\n## Step 3: Determine the total cost of hosting Rio de Janeiro in the Olympics\nTo find the total cost, we need to add up all the costs mentioned for each Olympic event hosted by Rio de Janeiro.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total cost\nFirst, let's convert the costs into a common unit. We will use USD as the currency.\n- Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics 2016: US$11.6 billion \u2248 $11,600,000,000\n\nAdding the costs for Pyeongchang and Tokyo Winter Olympics (both around US$10 billion) to this amount:\n- Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics 2016 + Pyeongchang Winter Olympics 2018 = US$22.6 billion\nThen adding the cost of Los Angeles Summer Olympics 2028:\n- Total cost \u2248 $11,600,000,000 + $22,600,000,000 + $10,400,000,000\n\n## Step 5: Perform the final calculation\nTotal cost \u2248 $54.4 billion",
