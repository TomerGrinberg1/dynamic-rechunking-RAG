The term \"Hadean\" comes from the Greek words \"hades\" and \"aion,\" meaning \"age\" or \"time period.\"\n\nIn 1939, the American geologist Harold Urey proposed the term Hadean to describe this early phase of Earth's history. He chose it because he wanted a name that would evoke a sense of darkness, coldness, and mystery.\n\nThe Hadean Eon is believed to have lasted around 4.5 billion years ago during which time the Earth was still in its formative stages, with temperatures soaring above 2,000\u00b0F (1,093\u00b0C) and volcanic activity being intense.",
